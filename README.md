Please add the file: to the robot_face folder that you send me, then directly run this file

#Camera.py
The 2 eye cameras will moves according to the movement of the head and the eye ball. Thank you so mcuh.

#Camera_eyetracking.py
Both eyeballs and cameras will be tracking the square object that added, the position of the object can be varied in the final part: if __name__ == "__main__". At the same time, the object can also be moved by directly using the mouse to drag it in the Pybullet simulation window. Thank you so much.


#Camera_eyetracking_optimize.py
The time step for eye_tracking and camera have been added, since when output image from the camera would lag the simulation, it have been set to false. Note that the camera can be turned on at the end of the code by set usecamera=True. Now the simulation have been optimised and it is very smooth. Thank you so much
